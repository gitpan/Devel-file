NAME
    Devel::file - show source lines around errors and warnings

VERSION
    Version 0.01 - alpha, more of a sketch that a module

SYNOPSIS
        $ perl -d:file -we 'eval { 12/1 };' -e '/a/;' -e 'die 123'
        Useless use of a constant in void context at -e line 1.
        =W=  -e:1
          1=> eval { 12/1 };
          2:  /a/;
        ...
        Use of uninitialized value in pattern match (m//) at -e line 2.
        =W=  -e:2
          1:  eval { 12/1 };
          2=> /a/;
          3:  die 123
        ...
        123 at -e line 3.
        =E=  -e:3
          2:  /a/;
          3=> die 123
        ...

        perl -d:file script.pl
        PERL5OPT='-d:file' script.pl
        perl -MDevel::file script.pl # run without debugger

DESCRIPTION
    Devel::file appends source code to warnings and fatal errors as a
    potential debugging aid. It provides handlers for die and warn in order
    to do this.

    This module is still in alpha and is liable to change.
